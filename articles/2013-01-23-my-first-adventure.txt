<h3> A Short Story</h3>

As my heart is racing I grip the seat and I think to myself I why I am here. "What have I done?" I quietly whisper to myself. The time begins to move slower and slower the more I look down at my watch. I feel the anxiety slowly creeping up my spine over time. The feeling of unease is torture and then suddenly I hear a loud voice through the intercom "We have landed in Australia!” 

There was this sudden feeling of being stranded and alone considering I was over 8000 miles away from home with only 1200 dollars to my name and no return ticket home.  I made my way through the airport feeling dazed and disorientated and I think to myself how stupid of an idea to fly across the world to another country with no return ticket and no friends or family for help.

I find my way to the train that takes me into the heart of Sydney. The first thing I need to do is find the hostel I was staying at, as these two big bags feel like they are getting heavier. I walk into the hostel and the place is a dump, I am staying in a room with 16 other people and we are all on bunk beads.  After two nights of waking up at 5 a.m. because of loud people I had enough. I started out on my look for a flat to stay at and I find a penthouse 25 stories up that had 12 people living in it but had a view of the entire city. I end up living there I paid the deposit and first two weeks which totaled out to 800 dollars and left me with 400.

Dead broke and out of a job I apply online to the STAR Casino and Hotel without reply I go around every restaurant on Darling Harbor looking for a job. I went a week without luck and decide to ask this Pizza restaurant a second time this time the answer has changed they decided to give me a trial run on Friday to see if I was worthy for the job. It was Monday so I decided to party and go to the beach with my new friends from the Penthouse “Unit 82”.  This penthouse is where I found my second family, “Unit 82” as we like to call us. All 12 of us became close and lived together like a family. We would have parties and BBQ, go to the beach, and cook for each other. We basically did everything together.
Friday comes around I do well and get the job. I work there twice a week for about $11 an hour.  It barely covered my costs to for the flat I was renting out. After a couple weeks I get a reply from the Casino and they want to schedule a interview with me. I go into the interview and sell my self they liked me. The next day I get the job and it paid $22.50 an hour, which was amazing, and about 4 days a week. 

I ended up living there for about 8 months just working and having fun in Australia. Then I went to Thailand with two close friends from Australia on my way back to the states. I will never forget how I felt on the day I left Thailand. It was a somewhat sad feeling. I knew I had to come back home and open up a new chapter in life but I felt successful like I conquered the world and it opened my eyes.  Ever since that day I know I can be successful in whatever I do.
