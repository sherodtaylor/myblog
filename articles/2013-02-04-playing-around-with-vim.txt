title: Playing Around With Vim

<h2>The Introduction</h2>

I decided to play around with vim today. I am just warming up to it and so far I love it. This is my first time experiencing the power of vim as a text editor. Ever since I started programming I knew of it and tried it once. I hated it I wasn't introduced to it and taught the basics. My main text editor has always been Sublime. Its a great editor but I just want to mix it up a bit and expand my knowledge. I'm still a beginner and in the process of developing a good work flow.

<h2>The Basics</h2>

There are 3 different modes Normal, Insert and Visual.

Normal mode is standard and think of insert as a special editing mode. To get to insert type "i" on the keyboard. It should look something like this:

<pre> -- INSERT --</pre>

Now to go back to Normal hit the "esc" button.

<pre> h     # is left in normal mode<br> j    # is down<br> k    # is up<br> l    # is right</pre>
