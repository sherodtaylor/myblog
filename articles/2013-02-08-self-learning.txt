title: Self Learning
date: 08/02/2013

I am a firm believer that our traditional education system isn't the best option for some. Others learn by doing and teaching themselves. Some of the most successful entrepreneurs are college drop outs e.g. Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates. I am a self taught programmer and have been teaching myself for the last year. I believe that being self taught is better than having a college education because it shows my passion and love for the field. It is true that college graduates statisically make more money then highschool graduates but it doesn't always outweigh the cost of going to a good school.
