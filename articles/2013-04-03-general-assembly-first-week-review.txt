title: General Assembly First Week Review
date: 03/04/2013

<h2>Week 1</h2>


<p>
So here we are starting our second at <a href="http://www.ga.co">General Assembly</a> which has been amazing. This last week we have been dedicated to developing a solid foundation of Ruby before we get into Rails. 
I have been teaching myself Ruby over the last year and I thought I had
a pretty solid understanding of it but it really showed me how little I
know. We have one instructer <a
href="https://github.com/tronathan">Jonathan</a> which is a great
instructor and is able to show us how to get things done. We also have
two TA's <a href="https://github.com/sferik">Erik</a> who is the a
manager of one of the top gems in the Ruby commmunity "Thor" and <a
href="about.me/bridgpal">Anil</a>. They are a great instruction team and
we have been learning a lot from them. </p>

<p>
This first week has been really heavy. We have been learning all about
the basic building blocks of Ruby. Everything from Blocks to Instance
Variables to using almost every method for every class in this language.
Here at GA we have been typically spending all together over 12 hours a
day just hacking away it code and I couldn't ask for more. They really
tailor the course to everybodies needs. We are fortunate to be taught by
such great instructors and they explain thoroughly computer science concepts
and try to really prepare you for the real world. They don't just teach
you Ruby they teach its background and the real concepts behind Object
Oriented Languages.

<p>
I'm coding is beginning to take over my life and I am so happy. To be
honest this last week I have been dreaming about coding. I know this
course may have been one of the greatest decisions in my life.
