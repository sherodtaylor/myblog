title: Vim Revisted
date: 03/04/2013

I just had to start a new post on vim my favorite text editor in the
world. I know that vim has a very steep learning curve and I'm glad that
I have adopted it so early because it is saving me so much time. So far
I have learned how to config vim and use all the different plugins. I am
using <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> a vim
customization with loads of different plugins. I don't use it straight
out of the box. 

<h2>.vimrc.before</h2>
<pre>
let mapleader = ","
</pre>
<p>
I like to use that for the leader key and I have a few different
plugins:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
     <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat">Repeat</a>
   </li>
   <li>
     <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">Commentary</a>
   </li>
   <li>
     <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">Nerdtree</a>
   </li>
   <li>
     <a href="https://github.com/Townk/vim-autoclose">Autoclose</a>
   </li>
</ul>
